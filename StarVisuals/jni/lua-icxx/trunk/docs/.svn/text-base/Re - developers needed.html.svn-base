<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Hi fellow
coders/programmers/sw forgers/whatever-you-call-yourself-ers,
<br>
<br>
Each of you have emailed me saying you are interested in participating
in the LuaCpp project (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="http://www.sf.net/projects/luacpp">http://www.sf.net/projects/luacpp</a>).
</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you are no longer
interested/able to participate, please ignore this email. <br>
<br>
</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Before I forget, sorry
for the
delayed response: I have just come back from a trip to Germany, and I
also wanted to wait a bit to get a few responses and at least have
*some* code in there :). So thanks for your
interest in this project, and your patience. <br>
<br>
The requirements for the project are minimal: <br>
</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">you're keen to apply
C++ to a fun project; experience doesn't
matter, but autonomy does<br>
    </font> </li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">you're keen to make
embedding LUA as easy and intuitive as possible from C++</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">you like what you read
here AND in the attached email<br>
    </font> </li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">you're able to read to
the end of both this email and the
attached one :)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">you like to "do
things right"; this doesn't mean not making mistakes, on the contrary;
just means that you're open to testing, refactoring, improving,
documenting, discussing, etc what you do</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">you want to work
together with other open source developers<br>
    </font> </li>
</ul>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You all have something to
contribute so you are all welcome to join. Naturally, the project will
get nowhere if this is a free-for-all.
So I propose the following: <br>
</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I'll make each one of
you a developer on this project (if you
reply to this email) so you can add/modify the code; I will only revoke
this if and when you are no longer contributing to the project<br>
    </font> </li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">We can use the SF
mailing list luacpp-devel for the technical
discussions (it's up to you to subscribe). My only
requirement of you is that you focus on the technical, and don't let
personal differences affect the quality or enjoyment of a
discussion. Note that as the lead, I will sometimes have to decide in
favor of one solution rather than another, I do this based solely on
perceived technical merit (robustness, performance, maintainability,
extendability, etc) and alignment with the project goals.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I'd like to set up a
wiki where "results" of discussions can be
summarized, so important decisions are "captured", plus new developers
don't have to wade through tons of
threads (but the threads are in list if needed). I'm like to do it on
SF with wikkawiki, but I'll use <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated"
 href="http://www.wikispaces.com">www.wikispaces.com</a> if setup on SF
is too difficult<br>
    </font> </li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I'll create project
page an initial list of "tasks" (on wiki), and each of you
just pick whatever you are interested in; naturally you can share tasks<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Everyone can add to the
list of tasks</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Any other suggestions
about how to do things are welcome<br>
    </font> </li>
</ul>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I don't have a preset
timeline for various aspects of the project.
Although I have been able to work on open source projects in my spare
time, regularly, for a few years now, my non-work time is shared
between family, exercising, programming, and (unfortunately) sleeping
and feeding.&nbsp; So I have to
apologize in advance if things don't move quickly enough for you. I
hope you get
as much fun out of this as I plan on getting. <br>
<br>
I'll add you as a developer when (and if) I hear back from you. Stay
tuned for the wiki/list of
tasks, join the luacpp-devel list, and take a look at the code in
subversion if you wish (really not much, but a starting point).
<br>
<br>
All the best, <br>
<br>
Oliver<br>
