# The Sun C++ compiler has a very special handling of standard C++ include
# files that don't have a ".h" extension.  It doesn't use the header name
# as a file name, but looks up the header name + ".SUNWCCh" in the file
# system.  The name + ".SUNWCCh" file is supposed to be a symlink to the
# real header file.
#
# The include path to the stlport header directory must be an absolute
# directory name.  Expansion of .SUNWCCh symbolic links seems to be broken
# if it's a relative name.
#
# The dependencies on create-sunwcch must come first to create the .SUNWCCh
# links before anything is compiled.  (The correct solution would be to make
# every compilation of a C++ source file depend on create-sunwcch.)
