This is ae, a general purpose arithmetic expression package for C programs.
It evaluates all arithmetic expressions, including nested parentheses and
all the elementary functions.

The need to evaluate arithmetic expressions at run time comes up every so often
and it's not the simple task it seems at first because of the subtleties of
operator precedence and symbol table. This package solves this need by using
Lua as the engine behind the scenes. Lua is an extension language that has a
very small footprint; it's available available at http://www.lua.org/ .

You can use ae while your needs are simply the evaluation of arithmetic
expressions. When things get more complicated (and they will!), you'll be
ready to use the full power of Lua, with complete statements, flow control,
and fully fleged user-defined functions.

To build, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua. Then run "make".
To test, run "make test" and "make xy".

Here is a brief explanation of the files in this package:
  ae.c          source code for ae library
  ae.h          header file for ae library; includes a simple reference manual.
  tae.c         a simple test program
  test.ae       sample input for tae.c
  xy.c          a simple example of using ae to tabulate a quadratic function

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
