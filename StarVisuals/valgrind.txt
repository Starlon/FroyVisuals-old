You'll need to build a custom system image with the changes.

To run Valgrind on the system server:

adb root
adb shell setprop wrap.system_server "logwrapper valgrind"
adb shell stop && adb shell start

To run Valgrind on an application:

adb root
adb shell setprop wrap.<process_name> "logwrapper valgrind"

Truncate the combined property name "wrap." + the process name to 31 chars if
needed.  The system property server has a maximum length limit on property
names.

Of course you can pass other arguments to valgrind or run other tools instead.

You MUST have root for this to work.
