      <h1><a name="intro">What for?</a></h1>
      <p>
	When writing <b>C</b> programs many of the bugs are memory related.
	They may result in strange behaviour which can arouse far away
	from the erroneous position.
      </p>
      <p>
	I once spent about thirty hours hunting for an annoying bug. The setting
	was bad. In a big project where a program (for which we don't had the
	source) read in libraries (written by us) at runtime and then used them
	a segmentation fault occured my part when allocating memory. I had
	just written some arcane stuff concerning binary file i/o and wasn't
	surprised that much. Of course it was not possible to use a debugger
	and we had to switch to good old <code>printf</code> and visual trace
	(step the code in wetware memory line by line) debugging. But I did
	not find nothing, everything seemed wonderful -- except that the program
	still kept crashing.
      </p>
      <p>
	It was a weekend and I hadn't had Internet access that time (it's
	seems so long ago that I remember dinosaurs stamping by my window).
	So I wrote the first version of the <em>malloc debug library</em> to
	see what happened. I linked it to my library and -- did not find
	anything. So at	last (it was a weekend) I linked it to the libraries
	of my coworkers	and indeed there was a off-by-one error in someone
	else's library. We love <b>C</b>, don't we?
      </p>
      <p>
	Since then I always use it in my projects from the very beginning and
	do only switch it off for release versions. It's an unrenouncable
	improvement to find memory bugs as early as possible without doing
	any more extra work than including a header and setting a command
	line switch in the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
      </p>

      <h1><a name="work">How it works</a></h1>
      <p>
	It's a simple thing. The <em>malloc debug library</em> implements
	wrappers for the normal heap handling functions:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><code>malloc</code></li>
	<li><code>calloc</code></li>
	<li><code>realloc</code></li>
	<li><code>free</code></li>
	<li><code>strdup</code></li>
	<li><code>getcwd</code>
	  (this is thought as an example how to wrap other library functions
	  returning malloc'd memory)
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	When allocating memory the wrapper functions demand some more memory
	from the system and use this extra space to write some special
	bytefields before and after the buffer they finally return to the user.
	Some of the extra space before the buffer is used for extra information
	e.g. about the file position where the allocation took place. When
	freeing the buffer (and maybe more often) the bytefields are controlled
	whether they are unchanged. If there is a changed the program is aborted
	immediately with an error message indicating the position where the
	erroneous buffer was allocated and where the error was detected. E.g. a
	common error:
      </p>
      <pre>
&lt;MALLOC_DEBUG&gt;  Corrupted block end (possibly written past the end)
        should be: a5a5a5a5 5b5b5b5b abababab aa55aa55
        is:        00a5a5a5 5b5b5b5b abababab aa55aa55
        block was allocated in rtest.c:181 [4 Bytes, generation 1]
        error was detected in  rtest.c:185
        Looks like string allocated one byte too short
                (missing the closing zero)
      </pre>
      <p>
	The abort allows you to switch on your debugger and inspect things more
	closely.
      </p>

      <h1>Getting it</h1>
      <p>
	The archive <tt>rmdebug.tgz</tt> is a gzipped tar archive, has about 15k
	and contains the files:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><tt>rmalloc.c</tt> (malloc debug code)</li>
	<li><tt>rmalloc.h</tt> (malloc debug header)</li>
	<li><tt>rtest.c</tt> (test cases)</li>
	<li><tt>Makefile</tt> (test cases build)</li>
	<li><tt>rmdebug.html</tt> (this file)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	Get <a href="rmalloc.tgz"><tt>rmalloc.tgz</tt> over HTTP</a>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#800000">REMINDER:<br>You may download/use/change/redistribute this
	  utility as you like but you do this at your own risk without any
	  warranty.</font>
      </p>


      <h1><a name="install">Installation Guide</a></h1>
      <p>
	Get <tt>rmalloc.c</tt> and <tt>rmalloc.h</tt> from downloading
	<tt>rmalloc.tgz</tt> from above. Compile <tt>rmalloc.c</tt> to <tt>rmalloc.o</tt>
	and include <tt>rmalloc.h</tt> in each of your files <it>after</it>
	the standard includes. Recompile your stuff with
	<code>MALLOC_DEBUG</code> defined and link <tt>rmalloc.o</tt> to it.
	That's all to use it.
      </p>

      <h1><a name="details">Detailed Information</a></h1>
      <p>
	First follow the <em>Installation Guide</em>.
      </p>
      <h2>Switching it on/off</h2>
      <p>
	If your sources are compiled with <code>MALLOC_DEBUG</code> the calls
	to the standard malloc library are exchanged by the debug malloc library
	functions. If you don't define <code>MALLOC_DEBUG</code> the calls stay
	as they are. Be sure that you have included <tt>rmalloc.h</tt> everywhere!
	Also be sure that you recompile everything after adding or removing
	<code>MALLOC_DEBUG</code> in your <tt>Makefile</tt>.
      </p>

      <h2>Testing it</h2>
      <p>
	The package includes a <tt>Makefile</tt> and a file <tt>rtest.c</tt>. Just
	say <tt>make</tt> and you can run <tt>rtest</tt> which should give you some
	output similar to this:
      </p>

      <h2>Changing the behaviour</h2>
      <p>
	You can tweak the behaviour of the library in two ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>Change some switches in <tt>rmalloc.c</tt></li>
	<li>Add some macros to your code</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Switches in <tt>rmalloc.c</tt></h3>
      <p>
	You can change the overall behaviour by setting different switches in
	<tt>rmalloc.c</tt>. Doing this has the advantage that you only have to
	recompile and relink <tt>rmalloc.c</tt> without touching anything else.
      </p>

      <ul>
      <li><tt><a name="test_depth">RM_TEST_DEPTH</a></tt>
      <p>
	Set this to one of the following three values: 0, 1, or 2.
      </p>
      <p>
	With <b>0</b> only a minimum type of malloc debugging is included. Each
	allocated block is only tested when you free it, there is no statistics
	available. Even if this uses the least memory overhead I never use it.
      </p>
      <p>
	With <b>1</b> you will get a statistic of memory in use when you leave
	your program or when you use a special macro in your code. Each block is
	only tested automatically when you free it. You can test every block by
	using special macros. For me this is the optimum of performance deterioration
	versus available information. This is the default.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>2</b> is the same as 1 with the addition that every allocated block
	will be checked on every access of any of the malloc functions. This will
	really slow down your program. I sometimes use this when I cannot get
	a grip on an error and want to reduce the place to look for the error fast.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><tt><a name="generations">GENERATIONS</a></tt>
      <p>
        Introduced in version 1.15.
      </p>
      <p>
        This switch is based on an enhancement and code from <name>Karl Brace</name>
        especially useful for memory leak hunting.
        It is either set or unset. If set, each allocated block will get an unique
        number which is useful if you have a memory leak and don't like to use the
	RM_RETAG feature described below. Assuming that your program internally
	takes the same path on each call each block will get the same number on
        subsequent calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        The statistics of used blocks will print some of the numbers of blocks
        allocated at a given file position which is not always useful if the code
	uses generic allocation functions. In that case you can set the environment
        variable <tt>BREAK_GENERATION</tt> to one of these numbers, start your
	preferred debugger and set a breakpoint to the function
	<code>rmalloc_generation()</code>. This function will be called exactly
	when the block with the number you're interested in is allocated
	so you can use the callstack feature of you're debugger to see where
	the leaking allocation occured.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the default configuration this feature is switched on.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><tt><a name="eloquent">ELOQUENT</a></tt>
      <p>
	If defined every action of the library (allocating, freeing) will be
	outputtet. This can really get a lot. When I have a
	<em>Double or false delete</em> error I pipe the output into a file
	and look if (and where) the given pointer is already freed before.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><tt><a name="silent">SILENT</a></tt>
      <p>
        Thanks to <name>Peter Wehrfritz</name>.<br>
        If defined only errors are printed, the startup message and the final
        statistic are not printed.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><tt><a name="with_flags">WITH_FLAGS</a></tt>
      <p>
	Defining this allows the setting of special flags for every allocated
	block. I always use it but it needs extra heap space. See
	<a href="#flags"><tt>RM_SET</tt> section below</a> for details.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><tt>ALLOW_REALLOC_NULL</tt>
      <p>
	Define this to allow <code>realloc(NULL, ...)</code>.
	To achieve high portability of my programs I don't allow
	this in my programs.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><tt>ALLOW_FREE_NULL</tt>
      <p>
	Define this if you don't consider <code>free(NULL)</code> an error.
	I have this undefined because I use <code>NULL</code> always as a special
	value.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><tt>BREAK_GENERATION_COND</tt>
      <p>
        Only used if <a href="#generations"><tt>GENERATIONS</tt></a> is set.
      </p>
      <p>
	This defines the condition to be fulfilled so the debug breakpoint
	<code>rmalloc_generation()</code> function is called.
	The given default (if generation
	is the number given in the <tt>BREAK_GENERATION</tt> environment variable)
	should work in most cases, see code for more possibilities.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><tt>MAX_STAT_GENERATIONS</tt>
      <p>
	Only used if <a href="#generations"><tt>GENERATIONS</tt></a> is set.
      </p>
      <p>
	This defines the maximum number of generations printed for a given file
	position/size combination in the statistics. Normally only the 1st should
	be of interest, so the default of 3 is quite enough.
      </p>
      </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Additional macros</h3>
      <p>
	To use this macros you have to make changes to your code. I agree that this
	is ugly but you will get something for it. All these macros expand to nothing
	when <code>MALLOC_DEBUG</code> is undefined.
      </p>

      <ul>
      <li><tt>RM_TEST</tt></li>
      <p>
	Invokes a complete test of all allocated blocks. It has only effect when
	<code><a href="#test_depth">RM_TEST_DEPTH</a></code> is at least set to 1.<br>
	Example:
      </p>
      <pre>
    <b>RM_TEST</b>;    /* tests ALL memory chunks on heap */
      </pre>
      </li>

      <li><tt>RM_STAT</tt>
      <p>
	Invokes a complete test of all allocated blocks. Prints out a statistic
	of allocated blocks to <code>stderr</code>. It has only effect when
	<code><a href="#test_depth">RM_TEST_DEPTH</a></code> is at least set to 1.<br>
	Example:
      </p>
      <pre>
    <b>RM_STAT</b>;    /* shows allocated memory */
      </pre>
      </li>

      <li><tt>RM_RETAG</tt>
      <p>
	Sometimes you have a functions which gets a chunk of memory, initializes
	it to some default values and returns this to the user. For the malloc
	debug library only the place of the allocation counts which makes it
	difficult to track down memory leaks because all the structures allocated
	in a function like that will have the same file position. With this macro
	you can set the file position to the position where the macro was invoked.<br>
	Example:
      </p>
      <pre>
    struct complicated *cpointer = get_new_complicated_struct(any_arg);
    <b>RM_RETAG</b>(cpointer);    /* file pos is now set to here */
      </pre>
      <p>
	or, since version 1.16 even simpler:
      </p>
      <pre>
    /* RM_RETAG will set file pos to the next line */
    struct complicated *cpointer = <b>RM_RETAG</b>(get_new_complicated_struct(any_arg));
      </pre>
      <p>
	Packing everything into a macro makes it even easier:
      </p>
      <pre>
    /* RM_RETAG will set file pos to the line where this macro is invoked */
    #define GET_NEW_COMPLICATED_STRUCT(arg) \
            <b>RM_RETAG</b>(get_new_complicated_struct(arg))
    /* ... later ... */
    struct complicated *cpointer = GET_NEW_COMPLICATED_STRUCT(any_arg);
      </pre>
      <p>
       If you have memory leak problems with a setting similar to the one given
	above and know how to use a debugger Karl's
	<a href="#generations"><b>generations</b></a> feature may be more useful
	for a quick shot.

      <li><tt><a name="flags">RM_SET</a></tt>
      <p>
	Set a special flag for the allocated memory. You have to define
	<code>WITH_FLAGS</code> in <tt>rmalloc.c</tt> or this macro will
	have no effect. For the moment there are two flags defined:
      </p>
      <dd>
	<b><tt>RM_STATIC</tt></b>
	<dd>
	  Used for memory which is not meant to be freed. Static memory will be reported
	  in the statistics only as a sum. Example:
	  <pre>
        static char *buffer = NULL;
        static int   length = 0;

        [...]
        if (newlength > length) {
            if (buffer == NULL) {
                buffer = malloc(length = newlength);
                <b>RM_SET</b>(buffer, <b>RM_STATIC</b>);    /* this is never freed */
            }
            else {
                buffer = realloc(buffer, length = newlength);
                /* RM_SET(buffer, RM_STATIC); not necessary because flags are kept! */
            }
            if (buffer == NULL) {
                error(NOMEM);
            }
        }
	  </pre>
	</dd>
      </dd>
      <dd>
	<b><tt>RM_STRING</tt></b>
	<dd>
	  Used for memory which is meant to hold a string. The strings will be shown
	  in <code><a href="#eloquent">ELOQUENT</a></code> mode.
	  <code>strdup</code> sets this flag automatically. Example:
	  <pre>
        struct numstr {
            int    number;
            char  *name;
        };

        [...]
        struct numstr *foo = malloc(sizeof(struct numstr));
        foo->name    = calloc(1, 2);
        foo->name[0] = 'X';    /* sheer nonsense */
        <b>RM_SET</b>(foo->name, <b>RM_STRING</b>);
	  </pre>
	</dd>
      </dd>
      </li>
      </ul>

      <h1><a name="rely">Reliability</a></h1>
      <p>
	This library was used on several platforms (at least Irix, Solaris, HPUX,
	Digital Unix, and Linux) by different users. It can help you find common
	errors like (moderate) overwriting of memory bounds or memory leaks. No problem
	using it with debuggers or other tools with different implementations of
	the standard malloc library because it internally uses it.
      </p>
      <p>
	It is by no means perfect. Writing to dangling pointers may or may not
	be found. Fat overwrite (more than 16 bytes) may cause a crash of the
	library itself.	Mixing the library with calls to the standard malloc
	library (because you don't include <tt>rmalloc.h</tt> everywhere or have
	compiled parts of your program with <code>MALLOC_DEBUG</code> defined and
	others not) will cause problems (e.g. when you use standard free with
	rmalloc'ed stuff and vice versa).
      </p>
      <p>
	<em>This is especially true when you use other library functions returning
	memory from heap than the wrapped ones.</em> You will get a <tt>Double or
	false delete</tt> error when you free that memory. It is simple to write a
	wrapper yourself for that functons. Just look how I handled the
        <code>getcwd</code> library function.<br><b>Attention!</b> The code was
	broken in version 1.13 which was fixed in 1.14.
      </p>
      <p>
	Despite of the warnings above I use it always (except for releases) and
	haven't had these problems. But of course I know what I am doing.
      </p>

      <h1><a name="others">Other malloc debug libraries</a></h1>
      <p>
        <b>WARNING</b>: Please note that I wrote this section in 1996 and have never updated it.
      </p>
      <p>
	There are lots of other libraries which do a similar thing (it's a common
	problem). If you have already used another library and you are content with
	it, there is possibly no need to switch. If this is your first encounter
	with something like this you should give it a try.
      </p>
      <p>
	I haven't had much need to use other malloc debug libraries, of course. I used
	a very early release of <em>Purify</em> and I have tested <em>electric fence</em>
	some time ago.
      </p>
      <h2>Purify</h2>
      <p>
	I liked Purify a lot but it is incredible expensive and makes your program
	slow because every memory access is monitored. So it is probably only used
	if you really <em>know</em> that you have problems. So if the problems don't
	show during test phase it's not used. But as we all know the problem <em>will</em>
	show when we present our program to the customer.
      </p>
      <p>
	If your boss listens to you tell him to buy Purify anyway (it's not
	your money and you will be glad to have	it when you need it). But until
	then you should use something else.
      </p>
      <h2>Electric Fence</h2>
      <p>
	Electric fence is freeware, too, but it uses a different concept compared
	to my stuff. It is programming your machine's MMU to protect the space behind
	the allocated blocks. If you access that space you will immediately get a
	segmentation fault. This is neat because you are really lead to the place where
	you actually write over the bounds. It will even react on <em>reading</em>
	beyond bounds. And it is fast because it uses hardware. But it uses more
	heap space (which tends to make it slower on big programs) and it doesn't
	find all errors when writing over the bounds because of alignment problems.
	Especially the problem of Test 1 of <tt>rtest</tt> is not found.
      </p>

      <h1><a name="releases">Releases</a></h1>
      <p>
        Some info on the various releases. Check here if you use older versions
        to see whether it is useful to update (of course it nearly always
        should). The most recent version appears at the top. Not all versions
        are described here because I was too lazy to start this section from
        the beginning.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Version <b>1.21</b> (2009/07/06):<br/>
          Avoided abort when RM_STAT was used before anything was allocated.
          Thanks are going out to Matthias Bilger for pointing out the problem.
          Added some aborts when functions are called on allocated blocks
          although nothing was ever allocated via the lib.
        </li>
        <li>
          Version <b>1.20</b> (2008/12/28):<br/>
          Fixed typo in <tt>rmalloc.h</tt> introduced in 1.19.
          Thanks are going once again to Frédéric Culot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Version <b>1.19</b> (2008/12/27):<br/>
          Added patch from Frédéric Culot to avoid <tt>size_t</tt> overflow
          in <tt>calloc()</tt> wrapper <tt>Rcalloc()</tt>.<br/>
          Furthermore I took care to <tt>#undef</tt> overwritten functions if
          the underlying system is already defining them as macros.
        </li>
        <li>
          Version <b>1.18</b> (2008/09/30):<br/>
          New <tt>SILENT</tt> mode and patch against compiler warning
          if <tt>TEST_DEPTH==0</tt>. Thanks for this are going to Peter Wehrfritz.
        </li>

      <h1><a name="license">License</a></h1>
      <p>
	Because I was asked to clarify the license of rmalloc from
	October&nbsp;8&nbsp;2010 it is coming under the 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">ISC license</a>
	(the main difference to the relaxed state before is that you'll have to
	keep the license text after modifications, which before was not
	required; otherwise you are free to do what you like):
